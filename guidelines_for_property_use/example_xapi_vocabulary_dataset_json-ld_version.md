## Example xAPI Vocabulary Dataset (JSON-LD Version) {#example-xapi-vocabulary-dataset-json-ld-version}

Some parts of the JSON-LD document, such as those properties using SKOS, are intended for use by semantic web aware processors, while other parts are for general consumption. Except for a few keys being prefixed by “@”, it should look like you might expect a JSON document to look to describe an xAPI vocabulary and associated verbs, even knowing nothing of JSON-LD.
