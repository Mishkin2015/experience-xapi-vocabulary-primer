# Whirlwind Backdrop {#whirlwind-backdrop}

Instead of defining a whole new batch of properties and classes, the more common approach is to reuse existing, proven ontologies and schemas where appropriate, adopting a minimal set of new properties and classes where they provide useful structure. Thatâ€™s the widely accepted way of using RDF in situations of this sort.

The next sections will cover the following:

*   The classes and properties that can be used for describing xAPI vocabularies.
*   When to use them and some use cases and scenarios they enable.
*   Examples of a vocabulary shown as Turtle RDF and JSON-LD.
*   How to use SPARQL queries showing a bit of what becomes possible.

So far, almost all the work on using RDF with xAPI has focused on Verbs. As a result, Verbs will be the main focus of the examples in this document, but it could expand with time to include extensions, activities themselves, agents, and attachment usage types. As that happens, there will probably be a document for each of these scenarios.
