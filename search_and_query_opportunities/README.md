# Search and Query Opportunities {#search-and-query-opportunities}

A brief overview of vocabulary search and reuse use is presented in the [xAPI Companion Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SmyEu5qxTdun-BVNoznhbInKXZ5xLKYp_49qyXa0Lqc/edit#heading=h.92yc9l555tqv). Publishing vocabularies as linked datasets opens up several opportunities for search and reuse. By exposing vocabularies as HTML and RDF it makes them inherently more discoverable, even in public search engines such as Google. Access and discoverability through public search engines can be also controlled and restricted on the server where vocabularies are published or hosted.
